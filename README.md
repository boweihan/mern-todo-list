### Simple Todolist

This repo contains a very simple Node/Express server and uses mLab DB-as-a-service for data storage.
The front end is built with React / default state management.

## Features

* Create/Delete/Update Todos
* Search by title
* Filter by status (within search results)
* Calendar View

## To run it

`npm install`
`npm run start-dev`

## Stuff I wish this repo had

* accessibility / keyboard accessibility
* unit tests
* some kind of state management (flux, redux)
* a build system
* containerization
* having "overdue" be a status type instead of an on-the-fly calculation
* user accounts (which can lead into more interesting features)
* localization
* etc.
